patrickmahomes,QB,1,"I don't have to waste my time telling you to start Mahomes. If he has a functioning throwing arm and two legs to move around the pocket, you play Mahomes. Chicago does offer a good spot for Mahomes to post a ceiling performance. The Bears have allowed the second-highest yards per attempt, the highest passer rating, and the tenth-highest CPOE on deep balls. Week 3 Positional Value: Top-five QB weekly",,,QB1,24.9,8300.0
joshallen,QB,3,"Allen bounced back from a dreadful Week 1 performance with a masterful Week 2. He was seventh in passing grade, second in adjusted completion rate, and second in passer rating. Allen will uncork some deep balls against this secondary in Week 3. Washington has been dreadful so far, allowing the tenth-highest yards per attempt, the 12th-highest quarterback rating, and the ninth-highest adjusted completion rate. Allen should have plenty of time in the pocket against a pass rush that ranks 15th in pressure rate and 18th in blitz rate. This will allow Allen to chuck dimes against a secondary that's also permitted the highest yards per attempt, the fifth-highest passer rating, and the ninth-highest adjusted completion rate on throws of 20-plus yards. Week 3 Positional Value: Top-three QB",,,QB3,22.1,8100.0
lamarjackson,QB,4,"Jackson might be the QB21 in fantasy, but he's not playing like a scrub by any means. Jackson is eighth in passing grade, ninth in yards per attempt, and sixth in big-time throw rate. Jackson is headed for a ceiling week against Indy's zone defense (82-83% zone for their starting corners). This season against zone, Jackson has the eighth-highest yards per attempt and sixth-highest passer rating. Indy's young secondary has struggled to open the season. They have allowed the fifth-highest yards per attempt, third-most passing touchdowns (tied), and the seventh-highest passer rating. Week 3 Positional Value: Top-five QB",,,QB4,21.1,7700.0
justinherbert,QB,5,"Herbert is playing good football as the QB3 in fantasy. He is 16th in passing grade and tenth in passer rating. He should thrive against Minnesota's zone coverage (86-90%!!! of their corner back's snaps). Minnesota has allowed the 14th-highest yards per attempt, tenth-highest passer rating, and the 12th-highest adjusted completion rate. Herbert has ripped zone in half this season, ranking second in yards per attempt, third in passer rating, and 12th in fantasy points per dropback. Week 3 Positional Value: top-five QB",,,QB5,20.6,7500.0
kirkcousins,QB,6,"The van driving Kohls wearing dad of the year is the QB1 in fantasy. Yes, you read that correctly. Cousins is at the top of the hill. He has been outstanding, running seventh in passing grade, third in yards per attempt, and eighth in adjusted completion rate. The Chargers pass defense has been paper thin, giving up the highest yards per attempt, the third-highest passer rating, and the eighth-highest adjusted completion rate. Los Angeles has defended the ninth-most dropbacks (tied) in man coverage. Cousins has been otherworldly against man this season, ranking first in yards per attempt, first in passer rating, and 13th in adjusted completion rate. Week 3 Positional Value: Top-eight QB",start,,QB6,20.1,6900.0
tuatagovailoa,QB,7,"Tagovailoa has been balling out. He's the QB6 in fantasy, ranking first in passing grade, first in yards per attempt, and second in big-time throw rate. He should shred a Denver pass defense that's allowed the seventh-highest yards per attempt and fourth-highest passer rating. Denver has allowed the 13th-most fantasy points per game despite facing the 14th-fewest passing attempts. Tagovailoa should have plenty of time in the pocket. Denver has the 11th-highest blitz rate but has generated the second-lowest pressure rate. Tagovailoa has destroyed the blitz this season with the highest passing grade and 11th-best yards per attempt. Week 3 Positional Value: Top shelf QB1",,,QB7,19.5,7000.0
trevorlawrence,QB,8,"Lawrence has been up and down so far, but his highs have been electric. He's 20th in adjusted completion rate, ranking second in passing grade and first in big-time throw rate. Lawrence is primed for a monster day against Houston's pass defense. They have given up the ninth-highest yards per attempt, the 11th-highest passer rating, and the second-highest adjusted completion rate. Look for Lawrence to chuck it deep constantly against a secondary, permitting the second-highest adjusted completion rate and third-highest passer rating to deep throws. Week 3 Positional Value: high-end QB1",start,,QB8,18.8,6800.0
justinfields,QB,9,"It hasn't been pretty. Fields is struggling. I could go on a long rant about Luke Getsy's play calling, the offensive play designs, the blocking assignments and protections, the abysmal offensive line play, etc., but I won't. None of those things will help you decide to risk it or shy away this week with Fields in Fantasy. Fields addressed the media this week, and to quickly paraphrase, he said he will play more like himself, which I interpret as he will grip it, rip it, and run more this week. I'm here for all of that. His numbers are rough but must be mentioned here. Fields has the fifth-lowest passing grade, tenth-lowest yards per attempt, and ninth-lowest adjusted completion rate. The Chiefs are a nasty defense against quarterbacks, allowing the seventh-lowest yards per attempt, eighth-lowest passer rating, and the sixth-fewest fantasy points per game. Outside of producing fantasy points with his legs, Fields can create chunk plays with the deep ball this week against a secondary that was susceptible to it last season. Last year, Kansas City allowed the sixth-highest passer rating and seventh-most (tied) deep passing touchdowns. This is the one area Fields has been able to rise above this season. Among 30 quarterbacks with at least four deep attempts, Fields ranks second in deep passing grade and first in deep adjusted completion rate. Week 3 Positional Value: QB1",start,,QB9,18.3,7100.0
dakprescott,QB,10,"Prescott has been game-managing. He's 15th in passing grade with the ninth-lowest yards per attempt, fourth-lowest aDOT, and the seventh-highest adjusted completion rate. This could be the week Mike McCarthy lets him rip it. Arizona has allowed the sixth-highest yards per attempt, the 11th-highest adjusted completion rate, and the third-most fantasy points to quarterbacks. Week 3 Positional Value: QB2 with QB1 upside",sit,,QB10,17.9,6600.0
deshaunwatson,QB,11,"I warned everyone this offseason that 2022 Watson could be quite similar this season. The former magic he possessed on an NFL field looks to be gone. Watson has the 12th-lowest passing grade, third-lowest yards per attempt, and second-lowest adjusted completion rate. He is 19th in fantasy points per dropback. That said, this is the matchup for Watson to turn his fortunes around. If it can happen in 2023, it should start in Week 3 against a burnable Titans' pass defense. Tennessee has permitted the fourth-highest yards per attempt, eighth-highest passer rating, and the 12th-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Week 3 Positional Value: QB2 with QB1 upside this week",,,QB11,17.6,6100.0
jaredgoff,QB,12,"Goff has been playing outstanding football. He's fifth in passing grade, third in yards per attempt, and second in adjusted completion rate. Goff is also tenth in fantasy points per dropback. He started balling out down the stretch last season and has continued to play well into the 2023 season. After demolishing rookie Bryce Young in Week 1, the Falcons faced Jordan Love last week. Against Love, they finished the week with the fifth-lowest passer rating, fifth-lowest yards per attempt, and third-lowest adjusted completion rate allowed. Atlanta's pass defense looks legit, also ranking eighth-best in pressure rate. Goff should have plenty of time to find open receivers, as his offensive line has allowed him to face the seventh-lowest pressure rate. Goff should post a solid stat line here but don't expect a ceiling performance. Week 3 Positional Value: low-end QB1/high-end QB2",start,,QB12,17.3,6500.0
genosmith,QB,13,"After a rough outing in Week 1, Chef Geno rebounded with a QB8 outing in Week 2. Smith looks like the player who stole our hearts in 2022. He's 12th in passing grade, first in adjusted completion rate, and seventh in passer rating. As good as those numbers are, this is a week to consider sitting him, depending on your options. Carolina has been tough against quarterbacks, holding them to the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game. The Panthers' secondary has also held passers to the 13th-lowest yards per attempt, the tenth-lowest passer rating, and the 12th-lowest CPOE on deep passes. Week 3 Positional Value: QB2",sit,,QB13,17.1,5700.0
russellwilson,QB,15,"Wilson looks like he might be back and ready to cook. He's 11th in yards per attempt, eighth in big-time throw rate, and tenth in adjusted completion rate. Wilson is the QB5 in fantasy. Let that sink in. Wilson is a top-five quarterback in fantasy right now. We'll see if Wilson can keep the train rolling against a middle-of-the-road Dolphins' pass defense. Miami is 15th in passer rating and 16th in adjusted completion rate allowed. The Dolphins have been getting after the passer, though. Wilson should have plenty of time in the pocket against a Miami pass rush that's logged the seventh-lowest pressure rate. This is despite their front blitzing at the tenth-highest rate. Wilson has been solid against the blitz this season, ranking 13th in passing grade, tenth in yards per attempt, and fourth in adjusted completion rate. Week 3 Positional Value: Borderline QB1",start,,QB15,16.4,5900.0
jordanlove,QB,19,"The perception of Love's quarterbacking has been puffed up by an unsustainable touchdown run out. Love is tied for first in passing touchdowns (six) despite ranking 28th in passing attempts. This will come back to earth, and it probably starts this week. Love's efficiency metrics are ghastly. He's 26th in passing grade with the tenth-lowest big-time throw rate and the lowest adjusted completion rate in the NFL (minimum 20 dropbacks). New Orleans is a defense to be reckoned with. They have held passers to the fourth-lowest yards per attempt, second-lowest passer rating, and third-lowest adjusted completion rate. Quarterbacks average only eight fantasy points per game against New Orleans (fourth-lowest). Week 3 Positional Value: Worrisome QB2",sit,,QB19,15.2,5600.0
derekcarr,QB,21,"Carr's play has been a rollercoaster through two weeks as he settles in. Carr is fifth in yards per attempt and fourth in big-time throw rate, but he's also 20th in passing grade and 30th in adjusted completion rate as he tries to get on the same page with his receivers. Green Bay hasn't been a pushover pass defense, ranking 18th in yards per attempt while holding passers to the seventh-lowest passer rating, but they can be beat deep. The Packers have allowed the second-highest passer rating and third-highest adjusted completion rating to deep passes. This matches up perfectly with their struggles to defend the deep ball in 2022. Last season, Green Bay gave up the tenth-highest passer rating and fourth-highest adjusted completion rate to deep passes. Carr has been hyper-aggressive, letting it rip downfield. He leads all quarterbacks in deep ball rate and deep pass attempts. Week 3 Positional Value: QB2 with QB1 upside if he connects on the deep balls",,,QB21,14.9,5500.0
samhowell,QB,23,"Howell has played well this season. While he's 21st in passing grade, all of his other metrics are promising. He's 12th-best in yards per attempt, fourth-best in adjusted completion rate, and he has the 13th-highest fantasy points per dropback. The Bills' pass defense has been a mixed bag, with the fifth-lowest passer rating allowed but also the 11th-highest yards per attempt and fourth-highest adjusted completion rate given up. Their pass rush has been quite good, ranking 12th in pressure rate despite blitzing at the league's lowest rate. Howell has played fairly well against pressure, ranking tenth in yards per attempt, third in adjusted completion rate, and 18th in aDOT. The slow pace of this game could limit scoring drives, but this game has sneaky shootout possibilities. Week 3 Positional Value: mid-QB2 with QB1 upside",,,QB23,14.6,5400.0
c.j.stroud,QB,24,"Stroud is learning on the job, which shows in his numbers. He's 25th in passing grade, 23rd in adjusted completion rate, and 16th in yards per attempt. Stroud could have a sneaky good day in Week 3. The Jaguars are 16th in yards per attempt, allowing the 13th-lowest passer rating and the seventh-lowest adjusted completion rate. These numbers look scary, but we also have to remind ourselves that they faced Anthony Richardson in his first career start and a ""struggling"" Patrick Mahomes, who has yet to get on the same page with his receivers. This is the same pass defense that last year allowed the fourth-most passing touchdowns and ranked 15th in adjusted completion rate. Last season, Jacksonville also struggled against the deep ball, giving up the second-highest passer rating and fourth-most deep passing touchdowns. What could throw a wrench in that is if Jacksonville's pass rush can get home. They are sixth in pressure rate. Stroud hasn't been good against pressure, with the 18th-lowest adjusted completion rate and second-lowest passing grade against pressure. Week 3 Positional Value: QB2",sit,,QB24,14.3,5300.0
desmondridder,QB,26,"Ridder has been a replacement-level quarterback so far. With two games under his belt, he has the second-worst passing grade, highest turnover-worthy play rate, and seventh-lowest aDOT. He also has the fourth-lowest deep passing grade and tenth-lowest deep passer rating. His ten rushing attempts (39 rushing yards) last week and rushing score saved his fantasy day. In his six NFL starts, that is only his second game with more than ten rushing yards, so I wouldn't count on the rushing production as a consistent weekly aid. Detroit is 11th in passer rating, 14th in yards per attempt, and has allowed the sixth-highest adjusted completion rate. Their pass defense is still finding its way, but their pass rush is in midseason form, ranking fifth in pressure rate. Ridder has crumbled under pressure with the sixth-lowest adjusted completion rate and fifth-lowest yards per attempt. Week 3 Positional Value: Low-end QB2",,,QB26,13.9,5000.0
macjones,QB,27,"Jones turned back into a pumpkin. Through two games, he ranks 14th in passing grade, 18th in adjusted completion rate, and has the fourth-lowest yards per attempt. Among 33 qualifying quarterbacks, he is 25th in fantasy points per dropback. Jones has averaged 220 passing yards with 7.0 yards per attempt in his last two meetings against the Jets with QB21 and QB23 weekly finishes. The Jets have allowed the ninth-lowest yards per attempt and the 14th-fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks. Week 3 Positional Value: low-end QB2",,,QB27,13.6,5300.0
ryantannehill,QB,28,"Will the real Ryan Tannehill please stand up? After a rough Week 1, he rebounded dramatically last week. Tannehill was first in passing grade, first in yards per attempt, and first in adjusted completion rate as the QB15 in fantasy. We'll see if Tannehill can stack back-to-back fantastic games against a Browns' defense that looks legit. Cleveland has allowed the second-lowest yards per attempt, third-lowest passer rating, and the lowest adjusted completion rate. The Browns also have the eighth-best pressure rate.

zachwilson,QB,31,"Wilson has been playing like...Zach Wilson. He's fourth-lowest in passing grade, tenth-lowest in yards per attempt, and has the eighth-lowest fantasy points per dropback. In his last two starts against New England, he has completed 46.0% of his passes with 6.8 yards per attempt. The Patriots' defense hasn't looked imposing, ranking 14th in yards per attempt, 16th in passer rating, and sixth-lowest in pressure rate. This is after facing Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa, though take it with a grain of salt. Wilson isn't close to being in the same area code as those other two quarterbacks.

He should lead the way in attacking the Packers deep this week. He leads the team with six deep targets. His prowess on go routes will also factor in heavily this week. Last season, Olave had a 34.8% Target share (20th), 39% TPRR (30th), and the 17th-highest YPRR on go routes (among 82 qualifying wide receivers). This matters a ton because the Packers have struggled against go routes in each of the last two seasons. Last year, Green Bay allowed the second-highest yards per attempt, third-highest adjusted completion rate, and the second-most passing touchdowns to go routes (per Fantasy Points Data). Olave has been running almost half of his routes from the slot, so he'll get plenty of reps against Keisean Nixon (88.9% catch rate and 135.6 passer rating) this week. Olave leads the team with a 31.1% first-read share (Thomas 26.7%, Shaheed 15.6%). The Packers have utilized zone coverage on 79-83% of their corner's snaps.

Last week, Bateman ran 80% of his routes on the perimeter. Bateman could be bumped up into a full-time role this week. He saw his route run per team dropback rate increase from 48.4% in Week 1 to 52.5% in Week 2. If we zoom in further, in the second half of last week's game, Bateman ran a route on 75% of the team's dropbacks, which was tied with Mark Andrews for second on the team behind only Flowers. The talent has always been present with Bateman. This week, it looks like we get Bateman finally unleashed in a full-time role. With his 23% TPRR and 2.00 YPRR against zone this year, he could explode this week while running his routes against the burnable perimeter cornerback duo of Flowers and Baker Jr. Week 3 Positional Value: WR3/4 with WR2 upside",,,WR66,7.8,4600.0

He'll see Taron Johnson (2022: 71.8% catch rate and 107.7 passer rating) in coverage for most of the day. The matchup is good, so if you are in a deep league, he's flex-worthy.
